					<img src="https://www.healthpopuli.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sage-SDOH-1024x498.png" alt="an infographic depicting the estimaged impact of different factors on human health">
					<aside class="notes">
						Of all behaviors that have an impact on wellness, exercise (joyful movement) has the most impact.
						If 40% of health is dependent on consumer behaviors (which is a generous estimate acc to my research), and we've already spoken about primary medical care. (Notice that mental health care is not really mentioned here, so it's either bundled with regular health care or is heavily dependent on socioeconomic factors, otherwise it's mixed with behavioral)
						According to current population research, your daily habits have a maximum of 20% impact on your health.
						This could be discouraging, but it's meant to be a relief. It's not all up to you, and there are factors outside of your control.
